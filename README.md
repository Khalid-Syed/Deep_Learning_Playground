A 10 layer deep neural network was trained on house prices dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivachandel/kc-house-data.
Using the correlation coefficient matrix from PyTorch, 7 most important features were selected from the existing 14 input features. The model was trained on this to predict the house price based on input features such as number of bedroom, bathroom, square feet of living quarters etc.
